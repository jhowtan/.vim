# System Configuration

In case of new machine / fresh install:

    wget http://jhowt.com/mac-ninite.sh

Run the script:
    ./mac-ninite.sh

OR simply:
    wget http://jhowt.com/mac-ninite.sh | sh


Should take a while to get everything installed and loaded up.

# Notes / Disclaimer

1. Script assumes no git is installed, machine starts from Terminal on bash.
2. Entire script depends on [Homebrew](brew.sh).
3. Personally, I use zsh, so please look into *mac-ninite.sh* before running the script.
4. Comments are included in the script.
5. Look up any application by yourself if you don't know what it is.
6. Script *should work*
7. If shit happens anyway just make sure you have a time machine ready.

Took inspiration from [ejamesc's](http://github.com/ejamesc) computer setup note (*as well as his bash settings*) to build this 'backup'.
