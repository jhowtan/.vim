# Installation

Pretty much for my personal use anyway.

In case of new machine / fresh install:

    curl --no-check-certificate http://jhowt.com/install.sh -O -  | sh

Or just clone this repo and run the **install.sh** script. Should take a while to get everything installed and loaded up.

# Notes / Disclaimer

1. Script assumes no git is installed, machine starts from Terminal on bash.
2. Entire script depends on [Homebrew](brew.sh).
3. Personally, I use zsh, so please look into *mac-ninite.sh* before running the script.
4. Comments are included in the script.
5. Look up any application by yourself if you don't know what it is.
6. Script *should work*
7. If shit happens anyway just make sure you have a time machine ready.

# Thanks to

Took inspiration from [ejamesc's](http://github.com/ejamesc) computer setup note (*as well as his bash settings*) to build this 'backup'.

Some other very inspiring setup scripts for a fresh Mac include:

*   [bkuhlmann's osx](https://github.com/bkuhlmann/osx)
*   [mathiasbynens' dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles)

(I forked the osx dotfile from *mathiasbynens* just so OS X is slightly more friendly)
